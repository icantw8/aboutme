<h1>Clifford Chong</h1>

<p>Greetings. This is Clifford Chong. Let me tell you about myself.</p>

<p>I was born in Los Angeles, California in August 5, 1991 so I am a naturalized U.S. citizen. I was raised in Burbank throughout childhood. 
I went to George Washington Elementary School and graduated in 2003. After that, I went to Luther Burbank Middle School and graduated in 2006. 
Finally, I went to Burbank High School and graduated in 2010. I first became interested in Culinary Arts after I started taking cooking classes at 
my high school in 2008. In Glendale Community College (GCC), I enrolled as a Hospitality & Management student and I took several interesting
cooking courses such as Elements of Nutrition and Food Preparation. In 2012, I switched to Computer Science. At first, I pursued an academic plan to
transfer to a 4 year university. Around 2014-2015, I switched plans to get my Associates degree and transfer. I graduated GCC in June 2016
after officially completing the program in December 16, 2015. I chose California State University Northridge (CSUN) because they offered
a computer science program called Computer Information Technology that I was interested in learning more about. I started taking IT courses
in 2016 and afte 3 years, I graduated with my Bachelors degree in Computer Information Technology.</p>

<p>In April 18, 2015, I signed up to become a Lyft driver. This was my first ever compensated work that I have done other than manual labor for
father's painting business. At the time, I was driving a 2014 Honda Civic sedan that I bought and paid for. The work was fairly good and I 
was paid more than other jobs I could've done. In May, I decided it would be better to switch to Uber because Uber had more customers and a
fairly larger reputation. I have drove for Uber to pay my tuition in order to graduate CSUN debt free! I could've spent that time doing 
internships but I wanted to stay debt free so that I do not have to worry about finances and stress. Working for Uber has taught me many
important skills related to customer service and logistics. In addition, I was able to buy a newer car which I was able to pay off and 
secure a healthy savings account. I took a break from rideshare in 2018 because school work started to become more intensive. In 2019 with 
only a few months of school left before graduation, I applied to DoorDash and worked as a delivery driver since I needed to work again to
pay my bills. Driving for DoorDash proved to be less stressful than Uber where I had to transport people instead of packages. Around July 2019,
I got an offer to start a 4 week training course at auticon US. Auticon (which is lowercase) is a IT-consulting company that exclusively
employs people on the autism spectrum. I was officially diagnosed with aspergers syndrome in 2010 but I had symptoms as early as my elementary school
days. I was able to apply for this opportunity after Workability IV (WAIV), a career assistance organization that works with the Department
of Rehabilitation and CSUN, informed me about this position as I was receiving counseling from them.</p>

<p>At auticon, I learned how to work as a software quality assurance analyst. I was excited to be having the chance to work in an IT position,
even though it was only 4 weeks long. In the first week, I learned about the fundamentals of software testing and Information Technology. 
In the second week, I learned how to create test cases using Google Sheets and what I have to do to make effective test cases for software
testers to use to perform their testing. In the third week, I got to create Bug Reports using Microsoft Word. As with test cases, I had to
make effective bug reports so software developers can look at them to properly correct errors. Quizzes were done at the end of every week. 
I was able to ace all four quizzes after studying hard. The final examination consisted of everything we learned during the four week training,
where the fourth week was mostly to prepare for the final exam. After hearing that I passed the training, I was informed that they would
start interning me 30 - 60 days after the training ends. Around October, where I was supposedly going to start the internship, I was told that
my internship was delayed until January 2020. In December, one month before the projected start date, I was told that they have delayed the
internship AGAIN until late March 2020...I was incredibly frusturated with the process but I decided to wait until then and try to look for
  work in the meantime.</p>

As of today, I am looking for employment by searching online, getting counseling from Hollywood Worksource center and finding opportunities
from my career advisors.
